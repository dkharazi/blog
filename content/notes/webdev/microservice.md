### Describing Web Services
- A web service is a general service that broadly refers to a web page (or application)
- Specifically, this service can do the following:
	- Receive requests from clients
	- Send responses to clients
- Clients typically communicate with a web service using HTTP
- An example of a web service is the Yahoo Weather API
- Another example is the Google Maps API

### Describing Microservices
- A microservice is a software architecture that is largely based on using web services 
- This architecture attempts to simplify a big application by splitting them into smaller applications
- Each smaller application serves one particular purpose
- These smaller applications are web services
- Specifically, this architecture allows a web service to use other web services easily
- By doing this, we can continue to create web services using older web services
- This will remove a lot of the redundancies from building many large applications
- The word *micro* in *microservices* just emphasises the idea of making these web services as small as possible
