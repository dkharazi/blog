### Describing Stateless Applications
- Statelessness is a property of a web service
- A stateless application doesn't store any information about a request on their servers
- Meaning, Sessions and Cookies should be avoided
- Typically, web services should be stateless if they can be stateless
- For example, a shopping cart is a stateful feature by design
- Therefore, a web application implementing a shopping cart should be stateful
