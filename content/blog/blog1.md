We generally use $\equiv$ to denote equivalence. Equivalence means *let one entity be equal to another entity*. For example, $\phi$ and $2+2$ are the same entity if we declare them that way, so we typically say $\phi \equiv 2+2$.

We generally use $=$ to denote equality. Equality is an instance of equivalence, and is thus saying something more specific. Equality means that two entities are the same entity. For example, $2+2$ and $4$ are the same entities, so we typically say $2+2=4$.
